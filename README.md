# Rappers Wiki API

### Introduction

Rappers Wiki API is a RESTful API, that pulls from Wikipedia's [List of Rappers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hip_hop_musicians). There are approximately 3500 rappers on this list. The data was created using a Python script that pulls fields from each rapperâ€™s bio infobox, and outputs a CSV. Translating that CSV into JSON forms the database of this API.

### Usage

- Run npm start to start the application.
- Connect to the API using Postman on port 3000.
